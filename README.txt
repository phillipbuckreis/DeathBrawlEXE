How to Win:
	In Death Brawl you win by pushing the other players off the arena or into the "Death Wall"
which instantly kills them. The player with the most lives left at the end of the timer or the last 
player alive will be crowned the victor. If the timer runs out and there are 2 or more players still
alive with the same amount of lives left, the match will enter Overtime where only those players are 
able to play and all players will be set to 1 life. In order to kill another player you must deal 
damage to a player using your Primary Fire (Right Trigger) and then use your Secondary Fire (Left Trigger) 
to push them off.
